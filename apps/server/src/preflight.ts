/**
 * Startup preflight classification (MIR-35).
 *
 * Mirror's actual startup sequence (see the entrypoint block at the bottom of
 * `index.ts`) is: build the app (config parsing, master-key/`MIRROR_STORE_KEY`
 * decoding, database open + migration) -> bind the HTTP listener. Each phase
 * fails in a recognizably
 * different way today; this module turns whichever one throws into one short,
 * actionable line instead of a raw stack trace, so a failed `npm start` (or
 * a failed container boot) says what to actually do next rather than just
 * where in the code it happened.
 *
 * Deliberately scoped to what can actually throw during *this* startup path.
 * A missing Playwright/Chromium browser (used lazily, only when a live
 * Turnstile challenge needs solving) and an expired ChatGPT session token
 * (only discovered on the first proxied/API request) are both real failure
 * modes, but neither one happens at boot in the current code - they already
 * surface through `GET /api/diagnostics` (MIR-09) with their own next-action
 * text once a request actually hits them. Claiming to preflight-check those
 * here would be checking something Mirror doesn't actually check yet.
