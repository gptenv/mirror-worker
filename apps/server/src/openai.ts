// Slow-consumer guard. Real backpressure (a client reading slower than we

// gone" on the first snapshot over some byte count - ChatGPTBox in particular
// relays every SSE chunk through a Chrome extension `runtime.Port`, which can
// legitimately let the outbound buffer climb for a few seconds without the
// far end actually having disappeared. So this only gives up once the buffer
// has stayed backed up past SLOW_CONSUMER_STALL_MS *continuously*; a burst
// that drains again resets the clock and is invisible to the caller. This is
// still not real drain-event-driven backpressure (pausing production and
// resuming on a `drain` event) - it's a stall timeout layered on top of a
// byte-count high-water mark - but it stops a merely-bursty consumer from
// getting its connection killed mid-turn, which previously meant the
// in-flight generation's transcript never got persisted and the next request
// from the same client would fail to match it as a continuation, silently
// starting a brand-new conversation every turn.
//
// Exported (only) so a unit test can drive this directly with a fake
// `reply.raw` - reproducing real outbound-socket backpressure end-to-end
// inside a test is impractical/flaky, but the guard is a plain function of
// `reply.raw.writableLength` plus elapsed time and is fully specified
// without a real socket. `now` is likewise only for tests to drive the
// stall clock deterministically; production call sites always omit it.
